# RB stereo 3d image/video converter

This project was made for cs111 at UIC. The assignment was to create a red/blue 3d image, which I expanded to batch create a 3d video.

## How to Run

To create a 3d image, simply run the program and choose pick, and select your left and right image.
To create a 3d video, the folder selection is currently hard coded. Simply change fileL and fileR to your folder location(s), change the output folder (pict.write), and choose numFrames.
